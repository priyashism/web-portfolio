            <p>Daenerys, Tyrion, Missandei and Grey Worm meet with the Masters, who offer to let Daenerys return to Westeros in return
            for the Masters keeping Missandei and the Unsullied and killing the dragons. Daenerys counters that the meeting was
            called to discuss the Masters' surrender, and proceeds to ride Drogon into Slaver's Bay with Rhaegal and Viserion to
            burn their fleet.</p>

            <p>Jon, Sansa, Tormund and Davos meet with Ramsay and his bannermen. Ramsay offers to pardon Jon for breaking his vows to
            the Night's Watch if he hands Sansa over. Jon counters by offering to settle their dispute with single combat; Ramsay
            refuses, saying that he is more certain that the Bolton army can beat the Stark loyalists than he is of beating Jon
            one-on-one.</p>
